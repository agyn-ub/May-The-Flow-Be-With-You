# Minesweeper Online - Initial Submission

## Date: May 18, 2025

## Overview  
This is the initial submission for Week 1 of the Flow Hackathon under the **Randomness Revolution** theme.

**Minesweeper Online** brings the nostalgic charm of the classic Windows-era game to the blockchain. Bomb positions are determined by **Flow EVM's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**, ensuring each game is unpredictable, tamper-proof, and fair.

The project is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and integrates with a **Solidity smart contract on Flow EVM** to request and verify randomness for bomb placement.
