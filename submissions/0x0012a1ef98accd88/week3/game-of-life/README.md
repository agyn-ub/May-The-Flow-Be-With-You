# Game of Life - Week 3 Submission

## Date: May 23rd, 2025

## Overview  
This is the Week 3 submission for the **"May the Flow be with You"** Hackathon.

**Game of Life** is an interactive simulation of Conway’s famous cellular automaton, reimagined as a Web3 dApp. Users can define initial cell patterns, and the evolution of the grid is governed by deterministic logic based on Conway's rules. Each generation is verifiable and timestamped on-chain, leveraging Flow EVM for tamper-proof state tracking and evolution history.

The frontend is built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, offering a smooth, responsive experience. Game generations can optionally be anchored to Flow EVM for traceable and verifiable evolution snapshots.

## ✨ Key Features

- ♻️ Interactive Game of Life board with customizable cell states
- 🧠 Implements Conway’s classic ruleset:
  - Underpopulation: <2 neighbors → dies  
  - Survival: 2 or 3 neighbors → lives  
  - Overpopulation: >3 neighbors → dies  
  - Reproduction: exactly 3 neighbors → born  
- ⛓️ Optional on-chain anchoring of grid state via Flow EVM
- 🚀 Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- 📱 Mobile responsive and optimized
