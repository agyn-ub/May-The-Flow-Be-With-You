# Week 1: ElementalStrikers - An On-Chain Elemental Battle Game

## Project Description

ElementalStrikers is a decentralized game built on the Flow blockchain where players engage in strategic elemental battles. Inspired by classic rock-paper-scissors mechanics but with a creative twist, players choose an element (Fuego, Agua, or Planta) and stake Flow tokens to participate. The game heavily leverages Flow's on-chain randomness to introduce exciting unpredictable factors like environmental modifiers and critical hit chances, making each battle unique.

**Core Gameplay:**

*   **Elemental Triangle:** Fuego beats Planta, Planta beats Agua, and Agua beats Fuego.
*   **Stake to Play:** Players stake Flow tokens to join a game.
*   **Random Modifiers:** Before or during the reveal, on-chain random events can influence the outcome:
    *   **Arena/Environmental Effects:** e.g., "DÃ­a Soleado" might slightly boost Fuego, "Lluvia" for Agua, etc. These could turn losses into draws, draws into wins, or amplify winnings.
    *   **Critical/Partial Effects:** A small random chance for a chosen element to have a "critical strike" (larger winnings) or a "partial hit" (reduced winnings on a win, or minor stake recovery on a loss).
*   **Winner Rewards:** Winners claim a portion of the staked Flow, potentially amplified by random modifiers.

This project aims to explore the "Randomness Revolution" theme by creating emergent and unpredictable gameplay experiences on Flow.

## Key Features

*   Strategic elemental choices (Fuego, Agua, Planta).
*   Flow token staking to participate in battles.
*   Multiple layers of on-chain randomness: environmental effects and critical/partial hit chances.
*   Dynamic reward system influenced by game outcomes and random modifiers.

## Prompts Used (To be updated as development progresses)

*   Initial project idea (Rock, Paper, Scissors with staking).
*   Brainstorming creative variations: "Elemental Showdown" concept with random modifiers.
*   README generation and updates.

## Technology Stack

*   **Blockchain:** Flow
