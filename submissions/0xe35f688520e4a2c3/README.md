## 📅 Week 3 — Generative Art and Worlds (May 18-24)

### Bag [🔗 View on Flow Testnet](https://contractbrowser.com/A.36e0dc989fe11d54.Bag)

**Bag** is a fully on-chain NFT on Flow, crafted with Flow VRF randomness. Each Bag holds 7 unique traits, forming a one-of-a-kind warrior identity. But it’s more than art — all mint proceeds are staked, and the yield goes directly to holders. Bag is identity, utility, and rewards — all packed into a single Bag.
